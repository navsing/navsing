    'Arizona-NOIRLab Temporal Analysis and Response to Events System (ANTARES), a software designed to manage extensive streams of astronomical time-domain alerts. Given the proliferation of large-format CCDs on wide-field telescopes, nightly time-domain surveys now reveal a substantial number of new events, surpassing astronomers individual assessment capacities. ANTARES serves as an event broker, processing alerts by adding catalog references, applying filters, and identifying customizable event subsets. The article discusses the systems data model, architecture, annotation, filter implementation, outputs, tracking, performance, and user interface in detail.',
