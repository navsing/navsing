  description:
    'The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will detect an unprecedented volume of transient events, necessitating a new follow-up approach. Automated alert-brokers like ANTARES will manage these alerts. A machine learning pipeline is developed for multiband optical photometry-based classification of variable and transient sources. The pipeline includes variable vs. transient categorization, multiclass typing, and purity-driven subtyping. Performance is validated on actual observations, showing competitive results. The pipeline is being adapted for real-time use on live alert streams from time-domain surveys, signifying a significant step towards advanced event management.',
