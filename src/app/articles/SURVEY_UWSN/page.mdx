  description: 'The study highlights energy consumption as a significant challenge in sensor network design. Underwater sensor networking facilitates applications like environment monitoring and exploration. Sensor nodes collect and transmit data to a central point. The report reviews recent data collection algorithms and clustering schemes in underwater sensor networks, aiming to fulfill ongoing research requirements. Energy-efficient data aggregation for long-term network monitoring is a key focus. The study presents algorithms that address deployment, localization, and varying conditions in underwater sensor networks.',
