  description:
    'The frequent emergence of high-dimensional data poses a challenge in underwater wireless sensor networks, as classical clustering techniques struggle with such complex networks of arbitrary shapes. This is due to their parameter dependency and inability to handle arbitrary shapes effectively. Traditional clustering methods fail to address the high-dimensional nature of networks with arbitrary shapes and enhance clustering performance. In response, researchers have previously explored fuzzy logic-based clustering approaches. This study evaluates these techniques to identify trends. The paper introduces a fuzzy-based algorithm for clustering ensemble, categorizing sensor nodes into multiple clusters based on major and minor criteria. The algorithm effectiveness is measured through clustering precision and its capability to differentiate between network nodes. Existing clustering algorithms for data aggregation are reviewed and compared with the proposed approach.',
